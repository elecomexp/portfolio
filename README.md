# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This is where I showcase some personal programming projects I have worked on or am currently working on. Each project is stored in its own directory (or repository) and includes all relevant code, data, and documentation.

## Projects

Below is a list of some of the projects included in this portfolio. Click on the project name to explore the details.

### [API Iris Flower Model](https://github.com/elecomexp/api_iris_model)

A simple lightweight RESTful API built with Flask for deploying a machine learning model on PythonAnywhere, trained on the Iris flower dataset. The API is hosted in https://elecomexp.pythonanywhere.com/, making it accessible from any device with an internet connection.

### [Basque Country Weather EDA](./basque_country_weather_eda)

An Exploratory Data Analysis of weather data from the Basque Country during the last century. Focused on temperature, precipitation trends and extreme weather events.

### [Battleship Video Game](./battleship_videogame)

This project is a custom Python implementation of the classic board game "Battleship".

### [California Housing Prices](./california_housing_prices)

This project focuses on predicting California housing prices using supervised Machine Learning models and clustering properties with KMeans. The implementation emphasizes the use of pipelines to streamline preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.

### [Databases Management with SQLite3](./databases_sql)

This project consists of two distinct components centered on database management and practical SQL applications.

* SQL Murder Mystery Game - You will investigate a murder in SQL City by applying SQL concepts and queries.
* Database Modeling - Create and Maintain a Database with SQL. You will design and manage a database model that stores information about suppliers and the parts they provide.

### [Diamonds Classifier with PySpark on DataBricks](./diamonds_big_data_pyspark/)

This project demonstrates the use of **PySpark** in [DataBricks](https://www.databricks.com/) to classify diamonds based on their numerical and categorical features. It focuses on leveraging Big Data tools and techniques for Machine Learning tasks.

### [Heart Disease Classifier](./heart_disease_classifier)

Implementation of a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using various features such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and demographics.

### [SmartCab with Reinforcement Learning](./smartcab_reinforcement_learning/)

A simulated autonomous taxi system built using Q-Learning and designed to optimize the transport of passengers. This project has been developed using [OpenAI's Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html).
