# Mobile Phone Pricing Analysis

## Introduction

Imagine you work in the marketing department of a major mobile phone company. In recent months, your team has collected extensive data on various phone models, focusing on sales prices as the primary variable of analysis. The general objective of this study is to establish reasonable pricing for future mobile phone models, taking into account market conditions and variables such as RAM size, internal storage capacity, screen resolution, and more.

This project applies various machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the pricing of mobile phones.
